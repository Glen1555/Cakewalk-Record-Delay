# Cakewalk-Record-Delay
Replaces previous version accidently named as Cakewalk Delay Record - The new version has great improvements.
(1) Helps greatly in managing the NOW TIME position during both recording and playback.
(2) Rewinds the NOW POSITION if an amount of seconds are entered to that position and plays back. When recording the playback stops and recording begins almost seemlessly, notifying with (Windows Tab) for high visible notice while at keyboard that recording has begun.
(3) In some instances, especially if working on 1 track the "sound on sound" is not needed thereby freeing up processing and sound quality while recording.
(4) There are buttons to quickly move the track position either left or right so as to center its view in the DAW.
(5) The original Delay slider has been retained. The Rewind slider was added in. Text boxes are connected to each.
(6) All settings are saved with a save button and when the program is closed.
